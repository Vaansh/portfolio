    Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. 
    Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. 
    Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. 
    Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. 
    Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. 
    The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.

    Some people see things that are and ask, Why? 
    Some people dream of things that never were and ask, Why not? 
    Some people have to go to work and don't have time for all that.
